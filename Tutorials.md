# Add an external force
1. Is there is a marker at which the external force is acted **AND** is the marker attached to the target part to which the external force is acted?
   - **NO**, skip this step
   - **YES**, Create new marker using [*create_marker()* in *class AdamSocket*](https://github.com/dixon777/variableNeutralLineManipulator/blob/refac/variable_neutral_line_manipulator/simulation/adam_socket.py)

2. Add external force vector using [*create_vector_force()* in *class AdamSocket*](https://github.com/dixon777/variableNeutralLineManipulator/blob/refac/variable_neutral_line_manipulator/simulation/adam_socket.py)
   - args:
     - *i_marker_name* = Marker at which the external force is acted
     - *j_part_name* = "ground" (which is automatically generated by Adams View)
     - *ref_marker_name* = Marker whose reference frame is used by the force function
       - If force function is based on the ground coordinate: "ground_base_disk_bottom" (which is generated by this program)
       - If force function is based on the disk itself: A marker on its disk
     - *x_force_function*, *y_force_function*, *z_force_function* = Force component defined in x,y or z-axis in the orientation of reference marker
