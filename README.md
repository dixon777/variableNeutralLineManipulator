This repo provides a user interface for evaluating and visualising the eventual orientation of a [tendon-driven variable neutral line manipulator](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6661461?arnumber=6661461 "IEEE") given the input tension on each tendon through a proposed static force model.

This project is part of the research, initiated from Dec 2019, subsidised by the [University of New South Wales Taste of Research program](https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/taste-of-research-program).
